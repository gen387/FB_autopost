It's my first program in Python and first time using Selenium, so it's extremely simple. But it works.

Install:
- python
- pip

Install using pip
- selenium
- libraries as in the python file (by, random, time etc. if not available with Selenium)

Download chromedriver and place it inside the catalog with fb_bot.py file.
